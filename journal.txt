Not enough code along, refrence; might get lost aong the way. Need to make sure I can find a source that can take me through start to finish. Will keep looking.. 
Maybe video source? Maybe Set up rails API and React-Redux first? 

---------------
Awesome and explicit source for API Auth: https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/token-based-authentication-with-ruby-on-rails-5-api 
    -We need an accessible model.
    -A way of encoding and decoding JWT tokens must be implemented.
    -We need methods for checking if the user is authenticated.
    -Controllers for creating and logging in users are also necessary.
    -We need routes for creating users and logging them in and out.  

Singleton Class: 
    -a singleton class restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object, which comes in handy when only one object is needed to complete the tasks at hand.

Authentication:
    -simple_command gem 
    -Instead of using private controller methods, simple_command can be used. For more information about installation, check out the article simple_command.

Auth works! Tested with user and got back a token!! 

In Rails 5, instead of having modules inhereit from ACtiveREcord::Base 'self.abstract_class = true' is added to ApplicationController. Now, the other modules will simply inhereit from ApplicationController.

-> need to create a sessions contorller and have app run a function to check which suer is currently logged in. 
-> https://medium.com/@wintermeyer/authentication-from-scratch-with-rails-5-2-92d8676f6836

sessions will save user info so that user can stay logged in to application, we need to ensure no overlap between code written in RAils app thus far and the one we want to write for sessions.
