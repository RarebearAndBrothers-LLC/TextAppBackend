Not enough code along, refrence; might get lost aong the way. Need to make sure I can find a source that can take me through start to finish. Will keep looking.. 
Maybe video source? Maybe Set up rails API and React-Redux first?

Awesome and explicit source for API Auth: https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/token-based-authentication-with-ruby-on-rails-5-api 
    -We need an accessible model.
    -A way of encoding and decoding JWT tokens must be implemented.
    -We need methods for checking if the user is authenticated.
    -Controllers for creating and logging in users are also necessary.
    -We need routes for creating users and logging them in and out.  

Singleton Class: 
    -a singleton class restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object, which comes in handy when only one object is needed to complete the tasks at hand.

Authentication:
    -simple_command gem 
    -Instead of using private controller methods, simple_command can be used. For more information about installation, check out the article simple_command.
